# SimpleScheduler

A Home Assistant add-on to schedule switches, lights, and other entities on a weekly base in a visual way without coding.\
You can keep all the schedules in one place and add/change them in a few clicks, even in your mobile app.

If something goes wrong, you can install it manually.\
You can add the URL of this page in your "add-on store" as a new repository:\
*Settings > Add-ons > ADD-ON STORE button in bottom right corner >  three dots in top right corner > Repositories*\
Click *Check for updates* and you will find the add-on "Simple Scheduler" listed.

If you are not using a supervised installation, you can run the addon as a standalone docker.
Take a look here: [docker_install.MD](https://github.com/arthurdent75/SimpleScheduler/blob/master/asset/docker_install.MD "docker_install.MD")

### Type of scheduler

There are three kinds of schedulers:
- **Daily**: you can set an ON/OFF time (or a list of them) and then you choose on which weekdays you want to enable them.
- **Weekly**: you can set a different ON/OFF time (or list of them) for every single day of the week.
- **Recurring**: you can set a recurring ON/OFF (FROM hh:mm TO hh:mm EVERY n MINUTES) and choose on which weekdays you want to enable them.

### How to use it
The add-on is very easy and intuitive (or, at least, that's the goal)\
Once installed, open the GUI, click on the round plus button in the top left, and choose your schedule type.\
Choose one or more entities from the dropdown, fill in the ON time (in 24-hour format with leading zero, as suggested), and select the weekdays. Do the same for the OFF time and click "save".

- You can set **multiple times** in the same scheduler: just enter them in the ON/OFF field separated by spaces.  
- It's not mandatory to add both ON and OFF time. You can leave one of them empty if you don't need it. For example, you want to turn off a light every day at 22:00, but you don't need to turn it on.
- You can use the words **sunrise** and **sunset** instead of *hh:mm*; if needed, you can add an offset (in minutes). Sunset and Sunrise times are recalculated every day at midnight and are reported in the status bar. Some examples: **sunrise+30** is executed 30 minutes after sunrise; **sunset-60** is executed 1 hour before the sunset.
- You can **drag the rows to sort them**, so you can keep them organized as you like!
- You can also choose to **disable a schedule**: the schedule will stay there, but it will not be executed until you enable it back. You can double-click on a row to quickly enable/disable the scheduler.
- You can **organize schedulers in groups**, that can be expanded and collapsed as you like. You can open, close, drag, disable, rename, and delete them.

### Conditions
For each scheduler, you can add a condition that will be checked at the time of the execution.
If the condition is 'true' the action will be performed and (obviously) it won't be executed if the condition is 'false'.
The condition is a template expression that you can add in the "template" field.
If the field is empty, no check will be performed and the action will always be executed. \
The template expression **must return a boolean** ('True' or 'False'). \
So be sure to "convert" switches, lights, and any other entity states to boolean. A few examples:
``` 
{{  states('switch.my_switch') | bool }}
{{  not states('light.my_light') | bool }}
{{  states('sensor.room_temperature') | float > 23.5   }}
{{  is_state('person.my_kid', 'not_home')  }}
{{  states('sensor.room_temperature') | float > 23.5 and is_state('sun.sun', 'above_horizon')  }}
``` 
If the template returns 'on', 'open', 'home', 'armed', '1', and so on,  it will all be treated as 'False'. \
If the template expression has syntax errors it will be considered 'false', and it will be reported in the addon log.\
Use the template render utility in Developer Tools to test the condition before putting it into the scheduler.

### Frontend switch to enable/disable (with MQTT)
If you want to enable/disable schedulers in the front end and/or automation, you can achieve that through MQTT.
This feature is disabled by default because it requires a working MQTT server (broker) and Home Assistant MQTT integration.
Take a look at the [MQTT.MD](https://github.com/arthurdent75/SimpleScheduler/blob/master/asset/MQTT.MD "MQTT.MD") file to know more. 

### Retry on unavailable
By default, SimpleScheduler will retry 3 times if an entity is unavailable. The first retry attempt happens after 5 seconds, then every minute. You can change the number of retries in the addon options.

### Hidden scheduler details
When you have a lot of schedulers the view can become messy. As a default, all the scheduler details are hidden, so you can have a clear look. 
You can toggle the visibility with the *eye* icon near the scheduler name. 
If you prefer to have the entire schedule always visible, you can easily achieve that by enabling **details_uncovered** in the addon configuration

### Dark theme 
If you prefer a dark theme, you can activate it in the addon configuration by checking the option **dark_theme**

### Translation
The default text language is English. They are very few words.
If you want to translate them, you just need to take a look at the configuration section of the addon.
Rewrite the words you would like to have in your language and restart the addon.
For the weekdays, as you can easily understand, only the first two chars are used.

### Two words about the stored data
Every schedule (or row, if you prefer) is a JSON file stored in the `/share/simplescheduler` folder under the SAMBA share.
This way the data can "survive" an addon upgrade or reinstallation.
You can easily backup and restore them in case of failure. In the same way, you can (accidentally?) delete them. So be aware of that.

### Log 
The log file is stored in the same folder where the JSON files are stored `/share/simplescheduler`
You can delete it if it becomes too large, but be sure to stop the addon first.
You can enable a verbose log by checking the box **debug mode** in the addon configuration.
When enabled, the log file can easily become very large, so be sure to keep the debug mode on only the required time.

### Last but not least

You may say that regular people need coffee to do that. Well, I'm not a regular person.
